            <p className="text">
              A poster is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to
              a wall or vertical surface. Typically posters include both textual
              and graphic elements, although a poster may be either wholly
              graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both
              eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many
              purposes. They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of
              events, musicians and films), propagandists, protestors and other
              groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for
              reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are
              generally low-cost compared to original artwork. The modern
              poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s
              when the printing industry perfected colour lithography and made
              mass production possible.

            <p className="text-right">
              Collage is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the
              visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of
              different forms, thus creating a new whole.A collage may sometimes
              include magazine and newspaper clippings, ribbons, paint, bits of
              colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts,
              photographs and other found objects, glued to a piece of paper or
              canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of
              years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the
              early 20th century as an art form of novelty.The term collage was
              coined by both Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in the beginning
              of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of
              modern art.

              Rangoli, also known as Kolam, is an artform from India in which
              patterns are created on the floor in living rooms or courtyards
              using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or
              flower petals and paints. It is generally done during various
              Indian festivals.The purpose of rangoli is decoration, and it is
              thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as
              they reflect traditions, folklore and practices that are unique to
              each area.Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions
              such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations
              and other similar milestones and gatherings.

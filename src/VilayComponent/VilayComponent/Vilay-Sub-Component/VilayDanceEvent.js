              Country/western dance, also called Country and Western dance,
              encompasses many dance forms or styles, which are typically danced
              to country-western music, and which are stylistically associated
              with American country and/or western traditions. Dance, along with
              music, has always dynamically expressed the spirit and personality
              of every culture. Modern western dance is part of this global
              language and its roots run wide and deep. They can be traced to
              the taverns of Ireland and to the ballrooms of Europe.
              Representatives from all of these cultures brought their native
              dances when they landed in America. Widely differing peoples who
              had little or no exposure to one another gathered and danced on
              common ground.

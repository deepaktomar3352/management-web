              Badminton is a racket sport played by two or four players, who hit
              a shuttlecock (also called a "birdie" or "shuttle") back and forth
              over a high net. The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock
              over the net and into the opponent's side of the court, making it
              difficult for them to return the shot. Points are awarded when a
              player successfully hits the shuttlecock onto the opponent's side
              of the court and the opponent is unable to return it. The game can
              be played as a singles or doubles match, and requires a
              combination of speed, agility, and precision to succeed.

              Basketball is a team sport played on a rectangular court with two
              teams of five players each. The objective of the game is to shoot
              a ball through a hoop (basket) that is positioned 10 feet above
              the ground, while preventing the other team from doing the same.
              Players can move the ball around the court by dribbling (bouncing
              the ball) or passing it to their teammates. Points are awarded
              when a team successfully shoots the ball through the hoop. The
              team with the most points at the end of the game, which usually
              consists of four quarters of 12 minutes each, wins. Basketball
              requires a combination of skills such as dribbling, shooting,
              passing, and teamwork.

            <p className="text">
              Volleyball is a team sport played on a rectangular court with two
              teams of six players each. The objective of the game is to hit a
              ball over a high net and to ground it on the opponent's side of
              the court, while preventing the other team from doing the same.
              Players can hit the ball with any part of their body, but can only
              touch the ball three times before it must be sent back over the
              net. Points are awarded when a team successfully grounds the ball
              on the opponent's side of the court or when the opposing team
              makes a mistake. The team with the most points at the end of the
              game, which is usually played to 25 points, wins. Volleyball
              requires a combination of skills such as serving, passing,
              setting, hitting, and teamwork.

            <p className="text-right">
              Shooting is a sport or activity that involves the use of a
              firearm, air gun, or other projectile weapons to hit a target. The
              objective of shooting is to aim and hit a designated target with
              accuracy and precision. Shooting sports can involve a variety of
              disciplines, including rifle shooting, pistol shooting, trap
              shooting, skeet shooting, and sporting clays. Shooting can be done
              for recreational purposes, such as target shooting or hunting, or
              as a competitive sport, such as in the Olympics or other shooting
              competitions. Shooting requires a combination of physical and
              mental skills, including hand-eye coordination, focus, and
              control. Safety is also a key aspect of shooting, as firearms and
              other projectile weapons can be dangerous if not handled properly.
